Title: Beautiful Berkshires Colonial on 7 Acres

Description:
Welcome to Maison Berkshires, a nature immersion! This beautiful historic house and red barn are nestled on 7 wooded acres, and surrounded by hundreds more, with no neighbor in sight. A place where everything is made to relax and disconnect: from the serene sounds of the streams running on the property, to the beautifully appointed house. Minutes from stunning hikes like Bash Bish Falls or the Appalachian Trail. 15 mins to Great Barrington and Catamount, 30 mins to Stockbridge, 35 mins to Lenox.<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />A PLACE TO GATHER<br /><br />Maison Berkshires has everything you need to create amazing memories with your friends and family. We come here to relax and recharge with our loved ones, and designed everything in the house with that in mind. <br /><br />This colonial house was built as a summer escape for a Manhattan banker and has an illustrious and quirky history. Babe Ruth used to stay here on his vacation where he hunted and drank a little too much, according to the locals. In the early 20th century, the owner published the town newspaper "Ye Occasional Idler" from a printing press in the attic. <br /><br />The ground floor includes a large living room with triple exposure windows, a mix of antique and contemporary furniture, and warm blankets to cozy up for those long evening chats. You'll also find a table where we enjoy playing board games, doing puzzles, or having an occasional glass of Berkshire Mountain Distillers Bourbon after dinner. Two doll houses and a "book nook" with a vintage rocking chair complete the space. <br /><br />The dining room is one of the beating hearts of the house and its antique table sits eight people. We designed it to be warm and inviting and hope you'll spend long evenings here, laughing and enjoying those moments as we do. We usually have a few candles out on the table to create a beautiful setting. <br /><br />The kitchen is adjacent to the dining room. We cook a lot when in the house so it should have everything you need to prepare delicious meals. If you want to check-in with us first about something you may need, feel free to do so! Equipment includes a 6 burner Wolf stove and many small appliances like a Nespresso coffee machine, rice maker, raclette machine, waffle maker and more... You'll also find a pantry by the kitchen where we keep more cooking stuff. <br /><br />A sitting room completes the ground floor. Located to your left when you first enter the house, it is meant to be a larger foyer where you can comfortably remove your shoes and coats as you're settling in. You'll find a built-in bookshelf with a collection of books and objects, inspired by the Berkshires and by the history of the house. <br /><br />The bedrooms are all upstairs and include roller shades on all windows. The Primary bedroom has a beautiful antique queen bed, a desk with printer/scanner, large closet and its own bathroom with a large walk-in shower. The primary bathroom has one of the best views from the house! Another bathroom on that floor is shared by the three other bedrooms. The Blue Room is another large bedroom which features a king bed, a desk, dresser and a half bath with a walk-in closet. There are two more bedrooms on that floor, one with a queen bed, dresser and desk, the other one has a trundle bed, closets and antique chair. <br /><br />A play room completes the upstairs. It has a tepee, toy kitchen, lots of kids books and many toys! There is also a small couch and a TV in that area. We don't have cable but the smart TV offers apps like Netflix, Amazon Video, and more. The playroom is open to the hallway that leads to the different bedrooms - it isn't a closed off room.<br /><br />The deck can be accessed from the kitchen and this is where you'll find our Weber grill and an outdoor dining table which seats eight. From the deck you'll take in a stunning view of the surrounding trees while enjoying the shade they provide. You will hear and see our brook on the western side of the house which feeds directly into Bash Bish Falls, the highest waterfall in Massachusetts. It is also a great place to observe the wildlife, like white-tailed deers, wild turkeys, all while listening to the sounds of woodpeckers and other birds. <br /><br />The barn is where we keep all the fun stuff! It is a gorgeous post and beam barn built by a local master builder with concrete floors and electricity. There you will find everything to entertain, including: a ping pong table, corn hole set, croquet set, balls, badminton net and rackets... and even a treadmill!<br /><br />The fire pit area with its Adirondack chairs is located next to the barn. We love making s'mores there with the kids and enjoy conversations while staring at the fire. <br /><br />A hammock is hung in between two large pine trees and is our favorite spot to read books and nap. Next to it is the kid's swing which can either be set as a "big kid" swing or a "small kid" swing. Both swings are kept in the barn when not in use. <br /><br /><br />A PLACE TO SKI<br /><br />The house is conveniently located near the two best ski resorts in Southern Berkshires: Catamount Mountain Resort, and Ski Butternut.<br /><br />Catamount Mountain Resort is 13 minutes away and features 44 ski trails, 39 with snowmaking, and 8 lifts. It offers some of the most varied terrain in Southern New England, and is suited for skiers and snowboarders of all levels.<br /><br />Ski Butternut offers 22 ski trails, all covered with snowmaking, and 11 lanes for tubing! It is a great and affordable family ski resort. <br /><br /><br />A PLACE TO HIKE<br /><br />The property is located in the town of Mount Washington, 80% of which is a nature preserve. Some of the best hikes in the Berkshires are within minutes, including the Appalachian Trail which is 3 miles away. Other notable hikes in the area include:<br />- Bash Bish Falls, 1.6 miles away<br />- Mount Everett, 2.2 miles away<br />- Guilder Pond Hiking Trail, 3 miles away<br />- Jug end State Reservation, 5 miles away<br />- and so many more!<br /><br /><br />A PLACE TO WORK<br /><br />Sometimes we need to get away from it all to focus and get work done. This house is a great one to do so with:<br />- Fast Fiber optic internet at 536 mbps <br />- Eero 6+ mesh Wifi network, for consistent wifi coverage throughout the house<br />- Printer with flatbed scanner<br />- Desks in three bedrooms<br />- Plugs everywhere<br /><br /><br />DISCLAIMERS / HOUSE TRUTHS<br /><br />This is an old house so it needs frequent care and upkeep! We fell in love with it and are dedicated to it, but also know that an old house may not be for everyone.<br />While it is perfectly sound structurally, you will quickly notice that most of the floors are uneven, and that one of the two stairs in the house was built with steeper and shorter steps than what we would build today.<br />Some of the beautiful windows are original, like many other parts of the house, and have been lovingly restored throughout the years. They are protected on the outside by storm windows which makes for a good insulation, but it also means you need to open two windows if you want to let the fresh air in. No big deal but we want you to be aware of that!<br />The central forced air heating works very well, and can be controlled from a Nest thermostat in the Sitting Room. The house is located on a small mountain at a 1,500 ft elevation and is surrounded by trees which means the summers here are cooler and no AC was ever needed in the house. It was also built with great cross-ventilation and we have fans throughout the house if need be.<br /><br /><b>Guest access</b><br />Everything!<br /><br />Unless there is a lock on the door... Three doors are locked in the house: one is a supply closet in the pantry, one leads to the cellar and the other to the attic. In the barn, we ask that you stay on the ground floor, as we use the mezzanine level as a personal storage space. Thank you!<br /><br /><b>Other things to note</b><br />EV charger installed on the property! It is a universal Tesla charger, meaning it works with Teslas and non-Teslas alike! The EV charger is affixed to the south facing side of the house and is available at no extra cost.

     Review: We had a group of 6 at Augustin’s beautiful home in the Berkshires, and we are still dreaming of going back! It was the perfect getaway to enjoy the fall foliage, minutes drive to Bash Bish falls, and an easy commute into Great Barrington. The home easily slept 6 of us, with some of the most comfortable beds and comforters we’ve tried! The ambiance and design of the home is charming and cozy. We  enjoyed our coffee (great coffee grinder and maker) on the porch overlooking the trees, or at their beautiful wood dining room table with soft, bubbly tunes playing from the speaker they provide. Cooking is a treat in their fully stacked kitchen. Augustin and Michelle were both really responsive to our messages throughout the stay. If we have our way, we’ll be back!

The house itself is a perfect blend of charming character and modern comfort, while the grounds and amenities made it easy to keep everyone entertained without getting back in the car. Lawn games and swings and bonfires and barn activities made for fun-filled days almost entirely outside enjoying nature. Would love to stay here again!

     Review: I have enjoyed three stays so far at the Beautiful Berkshire Colonial. The space continues to live up to expectations and has actually improved with each visit.  The latest enhancement is the stone landscaped seating are around the fire pit. All the home systems work well. The grounds are always well manicured.  The hosts are readily available and responsive to any questions or needs of the guests. If you like the country surrounded by peace, quiet and beauty, you won't be disappointed.

     Review: They've really thought of everything.  We were there in the summer, so when we weren't hiking through the beautiful surroundings, or recuperating from hiking, we played some of the unlimited collection of family games they provided:  ping pong and corn hole to name a few.  I never knew my wife was so good at ping pong or my son at corn hole !<br/>The same goes for the top end kitchen: not a kitchen appliance missing.  In bad weather (and we had NONE of that) you could spend your entire stay cooking whatever you wanted on the Wolf stove or using  any of the other tools available.  The bedrooms were immaculate and spacious, and the floors were beautiful, bringing you back to the house's origins.<br/>My wife wants us to come back in the Fall and bring our three adult kids again, and Louie the Jack Russell, who felt very welcome.

     Review: What an oasis in the midst of pristine and breathtaking Berkshire beauty! The house itself felt very comfortable and calming.  We appreciated the loveliness of its original historic self which is well preserved (gorgeous original floors and thoughtful historical details throughout) which however did not compromise the utterly modern comfort!  The kitchen was a total delight! Appliances, utensils, spices, coffee, tea...everything we needed to cook and bake and stay cozy (we did not eat out once!).  We enjoyed our evenings in the sitting room playing games, reading, and talking.  We would love to visit in the spring or summer, or fall as there is a good sized yard with a fire pit and a nice deck that must be fun in the warmer weather.  Augustine is a great and responsive host - nothing to add here: 100% recommend and hope to visit again.

     Review: We had a beautiful and restful 5 days at Augustin’s historic home. Everything was as described. We particularly enjoyed exploring the property. There’s a pristine mountain steam running behind the house—the flowing water is the only sound you hear, aside from the rare car going by. We had 4 kids and 2 dogs, who all love to adventure outdoors. The upper trailhead for Bash Bish Falls is less than a mile away. <br/>The kitchen and baths were perfect. We did a lot of cooking. The only thing we’d recommend is to bring some extra kitchen towels for clean-up and to hand-dry the nice wine and champagne glasses provided. <br/>New laundry machines were much appreciated, as we explored in the woods and got a bit dirty. <br/>The drive up the mountain to the house can be treacherous at night in rough weather—dark and tight turns on narrow roads. So be sure to plan your day trips and grocery shopping accordingly. Once you’re done for the day, it’s best to stay put and simply enjoy the fabulous house.

     Review: Our Airbnb experience was exceptional thanks to our host's responsiveness and fantastic local recommendations. All questions/concerns we had were met with quick and helpful responses, making the booking process seamless.<br/>The rooms are impeccably clean, and their selection of furniture, art, and overall decor exudes exceptional taste. What truly stood out was the host's commitment to ensuring our stay was as comfortable as possible. I had casually asked if there would be fire starters, and to our surprise, they went the extra mile and ordered them ahead of our check-in. The hosts were also flexible with our check-out because it logistically happened to work out with their cleaner's arrival.<br/>If you're seeking a host who cares deeply about your experience, this is the perfect choice. We can't wait to return for another memorable stay!

The kids (ages 14 and 11 1/2) really enjoyed cooking s'mores in the firepit, playing ping pong in the barn, and swinging in the yard. The home has toys and books for young children, as well as puzzles and games for adults. There's lots of space (both inside and outside) to spread out and find your own quiet space. There are several nearby state parks (both in MA and NY) where we enjoyed several hikes. The nights are dark and silent. This would be a great place for a multi-generational family get-away.

This home is beautiful, spacious, and well furnished, with a gorgeous and well-equipped kitchen, soft linens and lovely shower products, and toys and games to entertain kids and adults of all ages.   We were six adults and two children in total and we fit comfortably and slept well.  Augustin's well-maintained home features the perfect balance of New England historical charm with contemporary amenities.   The area is breathtaking, woodsy, and rural--the Guilder Pond and Bash Bish hiking trails were very manageable with small kids--and in just 15 minutes you're in downtown Great Barrington with access to delicious restaurants and an impressive arts and culture scene.  I highly recommend a retreat at Augustin's home.

     Review: The house was exactly as described, an old home beautifully restored and modernized located on a lovely piece of property. The furnishings and beds were very comfortable and inviting, whether in a group or curling up on a chair alone. There were toys and games, a play kitchen and a wonderful dollhouse that my grandchildren loved. The kitchen is gorgeous and supplied with everything possible. And the barn has ping pong table and treadmill. Unfortunately, the remote location made wifi service spotty with no phone service at all. And unless you're willing to drive 20 minutes or so on back roads to the grocery stores, it's important to bring everything you'll need.  Augustin was very helpful with any issues that came up. We thoroughly enjoyed our long weekend and hope to come back another time.

     Review: My elderly mother, toddler, wife and myself certainly benefitted from the peace and tranquility of this house and surroundings. The place is on the edge of a forest, situated between two small creeks that combined with all the bird calls made for terrific background noise. Air quality with so much green around was mostly terrific even with the Canada wildfire smoke always a potential menace. Only concern coming in was confirmed and discussed in advance with Augustin (front stairs present much difficulty climbing for anyone elderly but back stairs were much more managable for mom). Once there, out July visit coincidentally brought with it maybe the only couple of weeks a year where a house A/C would’ve been great.  Still, we managed with the box fans provided and open windows. Overall both Augustin and their beautifully charming and welcoming home are highly recommended.

We had a great stay, thanks Augustin!
